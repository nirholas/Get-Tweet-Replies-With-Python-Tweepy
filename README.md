# Get-Tweet-Replies-With-Python-Tweepy
## Extract Replies to a Specific Tweet using Python and Tweepy

I was searching for an easy way to extract the replies of a certain tweet. After no success searching open-source code I decided to try this, and it works!

You will want to have a [Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/) and you will need to add your keys within the code. 

Navigate to where you downloaded your code, assuring you have [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) installed within the same environment. 

Run

```python
python3 twitter_reply.py
```
The replies will be in a .csv file within the same directory. 

* Twitter has updated their API in which you will need an elevated API access, I am working on a workaround. *
